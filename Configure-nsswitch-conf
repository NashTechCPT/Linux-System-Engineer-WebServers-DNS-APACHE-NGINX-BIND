# Nameserver Switch 
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
  The Nameserver Switch or nsswitch file is used by applications to determine sources to get name service information from. 
  Not only for domain name resolution order but rather for multiple categories 
  Each category of information is identified by a database name
  
  The first column of the file is the database name then the remaining columns specify the order in which to look up the data. 
  
 The following databases are understood: 

  - aliases for mail aliases
  - 'ethers' for ethernet numbers
  - groups for groups of users
  - hosts for hostnames and numbers
  - initgroup for supplementary group lists
  - netgroup for network groups
  - networks for network names and numbers
  - passwd for passwords
  - protocols for network protocols
  - publickey for secret keys used by NFS (Network File System) and NIS+ (Network Information Service)
  - rpc for remote procedure call numbers
  - services for network services 
  - shadow for shadow passwords
  
# Hosts Database Options

 for common situations:
    Specifies to resolve host names used in the local name resolution file, /etc/hosts
   - files
 
   Instruct the client to resolve via DNS: 
   - dns
 
     - files and -dns will try them in order left to right
         for instance, it's common to use host, colon, space:
         - hosts: files dns
           This way it will consult the etc host file first and try to resolve DNS second
           This allows us to override DNS with a local etc host entry. 
           
        # status
             After each option we can have an option status and an action inside square brackets:
             - success
               No errors occurred 
             - notfound
               lookup succeeded but the entry was not found
             - unavail
               the service is permanently unavailable
             - tryagain
               service is temporarily unavailable

               Status Example: 
                 hosts: dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
                 
         # actions
           - return
             returns the result right away
           - continue
             moves on to the next method in the list
           - merge
             allows the system to move onto the next method after finding a result and then merges the results
             
             Negated status with action using the "!"
             Example: 
                 hosts: dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
             
           
 
 for hosting resolution:
   - nis
   
   - nisplus
