# Commands

# Dependencies: 
   sudo apt install -y bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc dnsutils
   cd /etc/bind - contains all bind configuration files
   
         Step 2) Configure Bind 9 (DNS Server)
            Once all the packages have been installed, we will move into the configuration part. All configuration files for BIND are located in folder ‘/etc/bind’.

            One of the important configuration file for bind is “/etc/bind/named.conf.options“, from this file we can set the followings parameters:

            Allow Query to your dns from your private network (As the name suggests only the systems from your private network can query dns sever for name to ip translation and vice-versa)
            Allow recursive query
            Specify the DNS port ( 53)
            Frwarders (DNS query will be forwarded to the forwarders when your local DNS server is unable to resolve query)

   fileS includes Global options plus zone and include statements:
      All statements start with a left curly bracket "{" a right curly bracket "}" and a semicolon ";"
      
      sudo less /etc/bind/named.conf
      
       // This is the primary configuration file for the BIND DNS server named.
      //
      // Please read /usr/share/doc/bind9/README.Debian for information on the
      // structure of BIND configuration files in Debian, *BEFORE* you customize
      // this configuration file.
      //
      // If you are just adding zones, please do that in /etc/bind/named.conf.local

      include "/etc/bind/named.conf.options";
      
                options {

                // If there is a firewall between you and nameservers you want
                // to talk to, you may need to fix the firewall to allow multiple
                // ports to talk.  See http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113

                // If your ISP provided one or more IP addresses for stable 
                // nameservers, you probably want to use them as forwarders.  
                // Uncomment the following block, and insert the addresses replacing 
                // the all-0's placeholder.
