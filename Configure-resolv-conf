Client-Side Resolve Configuration 


# /etc/resolv.conf
 
 Column1: 
  The purpose of resolv.conf is to provide a list of Global DNS servers for our client to query when resolving DNS names.
  
  - Search 
    localnet.com ford.com apple.com 
      if no search line default to local domain name: yourlocaldomainname.localnet.com
    
  - Domain
    append the domain to the end of a short name: 
      domain otherdomain.com
        yourlocaldomainname.otherdomain.com
    
  - nameserver
    followed by a DNS Server IP address to query
      nameserver 4.2.2.2
      you can have up to 3 nameserver lines and the client will query them in the order they're listed: 
        nameserver 8.8.8.8
        nameserver 192.168.1.21
   
  - sortlist
    Allows us to sort IP addresses in certain networks: 
      sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0
        allows up to 10 network and subnet pairs
        
  - options
    Lets us set DNS client options such as querying the nameservers round robin to spread the load
    A timeout
    A number of times the client will query the DNS server before giving up
      options rotate
      options timeout:5
      options attempts:2
      
      /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts-ifcfg-eth0
      BOOTPROTO=dhcp
      DEFROUTE=yes
      NAME=enp0s3
      ONBOOT=yes

      If you want to set DNS Nameservers per network interface, you can do so by adding them to the interface specific network configuration files.     
       The global configuration file is /etc/resolve.conf
        DNS1=4.2.2.2
        DNS1=8.8.8.8
        
        If you set your DNS servers in the interface specific configuration file and you also set PEERDNS=yes then those DNS serves will get copied to
        /etc/resolv.conf automatically.
